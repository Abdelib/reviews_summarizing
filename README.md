<h1 align="center">Reviews summarizing Project</h1>

## Project Description 

This proejct is about building an algorithm that'd be able to take all the reviews for a certain product and generate one single review that summarizes all the reviews. T

So that instead of having a customer reading 200 reviews, he’ll only have to read one review. 

In this case i crawled the Nike.com website using a scrapping tool called Scrappy while using a container and gathered all the data about the Men's shoes, then the algorithm was able to create a summarized review for every single shoe. The algorithm was also able to clean the data from any duplicate reviews and clean the data so it doesn’t show products that don't have any reviews. Although the more data and reviews there's for a shoe, the easier it is for the algorithm to create a summzarized review.

The libraries used for the algorithm are nltk, re and heapq. They're all libraries that help sorrt and summarize text while also choosing the language and sort your text in order to give the best solution.
