The fit like a glove to your feet and provide you with that extra bounce you need to keep your day going. I play basketball and I used to wear slides to and from the game until I discovered vapormax. Now I wear vapormax to and from the game because of comfort and they also provide a stylist look. My only dislike about this shoe is that on the exterior of the shoe facing inside after a long amount of wear there is a small tear on both shoes. How this my be a one time thing. I still highly recommend these shoes and if your still not completely sold I have 13 pair of shoes in all that all fit and I wear on a regular basis and out of those 13 there are 12 that are vapormax and the other are basketball shoes. They are not all this style however all 12 are vapormax. "

The shoe is pretty comfortable and can have extra support along the mid-foot and arch area by strapping down the middle support wing. The color selection is overall fairly neutral, but unique enough with the lock/key design on the shoe tongue, the purple Velcro wing, and the mismatched colors of the Nike logo on the toe area. The design is certainly visually interesting, just not my personal style. The shoes seem to run a bit small, so would recommend sizing up a 1/2 size at least. The shoes are quite comfortable, but did feel a little on the heavy side (likely due to increased support for play). I also prefer more ankle support for basketball shoes, so the low profile is less ideal. I did not care for the plastic wing along the mid foot, as it is an extra step when putting in the shoes and taking them off and it is quite bulky. Overall, good materials and quality, just not my style."

That upper is so light and breathes like crazy. The outsole traction is great. The nods to the OG 6 are there, and are subtle so the don't overpower the shoe. The only *bad* thing is that they run small in the toe box. I wear a 12 but had to get a 13 to be comfortable, so keep that in mind when you order."

The design is really unique- I've had several 'sneakerheads' impressed with them and asked where I was able to get a pair, but they are bright and it can be polarizing for people who want a more modest looking athletic shoe. Overall, I've been very happy with them but have to drop one star rating as the sizing runs a little on the smaller size, especially the toe box, so plan accordingly.

These shoes also made me feel taller and even though I've been wearing them almost every day since I received them,  they still look brand new!  The only thing I would change is I wish they made them in women's sizes!!  I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone who wants a comfortable, cool looking shoe!"

With a weak ankle, I can’t play basketball without that kind of support and these shoes felt very stable. I also liked the back pull loop to make these easier to get on. "

Overall, no issues on fit at all and is a well made, quality sneaker. 4 stars, instead of 5, only because I wouldn't wear them to do sports - the sole seems too soft."

I would say the sizing is spot on, so when I ordered the 9.5 they fit me like a glove. The primary thing I noticed when I first put them on was the ample arch support and a very cushioned sole. The first day I just wore them around the house, and I found them to be extremely comfortable.  At first I found the ankle area to be a little stiff, but after breaking them in a little,  that issue disappeared. A day later I wore these guys to play basketball. One of the coolest things about the shoe is the actual soles. What impressed me most was the grip. These shoes probably have the best traction of any of the shoes I've owned. I like that the soles are thick too, so it gives a little lift."

The color combination is unique and gives an urban look without compromising on the required aspects. The heel has blue suede duels with hot 'Flash Crimson' heel tabs to provide stability. The forefront part is also equally comfortable and matches the design used for heels. The cool part is 'JORDAN' is spelled out on the shoes to make these stand out from the other shoes. I am enjoying wearing these all day and goes really well with most of the casual wear clothing. I like the shoes as it is and doesn't have any further recommendations for improvements."

I ended up wearing them, and I’m a women’s size 8, so they were large on me, but I still found them very comfortable, but would have preferred them in a smaller size. I will say, wide feet would probably find this uncomfortable, as my husband did. Based on how large they were on me, I’d say size up half a size would be a safe bet. "

I like how the Nike swoosh has a “colored outside the lines” look.  I don’t like the white soul which is immediately dirty after wearing outside. I have had issues with sneakers in the recent past causing serious ankle pain anytime I run.  So far, so good with these shoes. I don’t have any of this pain after a few miles with these. I like the look and feel of these shoes, the weight and the comfort. They are a little tight and the laces are a bit short. Could use another 2-3 inches on the laces and I think I would not notice the tightness."

The one downside is that they are a bit tight.  I have them in my normal size, but might have sized up half a size for a more comfortable fit.  I hope these will last, normally I will rip through the sides of the shoe (side near pinki toe) after a few months due to the nature of my job, but I’m hopeful these will hold up!"

I've owned any and all brands of golf shoes including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Footjoy,  GFore, Truelinkswear.  I'm loyal to no brand of shoes.  These shoes feel very similar to the Air Max 90 sneaker version.  Grip is pretty good and have had no issues there.  I would say that these fit similar to the sneaker version but with the waterproofing on the shoe there is a little less give making the toe box a feel a bit snug compared to the street shoe.  I normally wear a size 11, I went with size 11 in these and they work great.  If you have a wider foot go up half a size.  If you have a normal to narrow foot go true to size."

For those people that like a firm hard strike and push off these might not be right for you. However, after giving the shoes a chance to break in I am pleasantly surprised by the comfort and cushion. It takes time to get use to it. At first I felt some pain and tension around the knee like another reviewer mentioned. After the shoe shoe broke in it was well worth it.

One more very important thing is the front foot area is just slightly wider and that really helps for my toes from getting blisters. Blister free runs days after days.   These shoes seems to be very durable too. Im 130lbs and Im into 600 miles on my first pair(55 average weekly mileage)  and they dont show any sign of wear or tear. The lock down is excellent.

It is too bad because they look so good and are comfortable. Not sure I will ever wear them again because of the squeaking. I keep them in my locker so they are not wet.

I ran with those the first day which felt great but was looking forward to comparing with the 2090's which felt a bit heavier and different in how my feet hit the pavement. There's a bit more bounce and propulsion with the React pair and looking forward to running in them again tomorrow. "

Took one wear to make them fit right but they are very comfortable and provides good stablilty for cadio involving high impact movement like repeatitive jumping. I haven't owned these long enough to know how they hold up after regular long time use. I hope they won't let me down because my experiance with Nike kicks is they're awesome for the first couple months but don't last long after regular use. We shall see."

I have used orthotics for quite some time because of a hip injury.  I have yet to even feel the need to put them in this shoe.  As a matter of fact, my hip actually feels better when I wear these. Wish I could buy them in every colorway because of that alone. I know everyone is made different, but for me, these are everything. They have change my life in terms of comfort."

They are ridiculously comfortable and fit like they were made for my feet. I’ve been wearing these shoes for about 2-3 weeks now and they are my new go to sneaker. I can wear them all day with no discomfort, no back pain (that says a lot for being a 45 year old mad), and no sweaty feet.

They’re just enough so my shoes match pretty much all my athletic and leisure wear. I am able to wear it to work all day (I work in healthcare) and then go pick up the kids after school and still go on walks with them after. Love how versatile, stylish, and comfy they are.

Definitely more of a casual shoe than a running shoe unlike how they were advertised. If you want real running shoes upgrade to the Pegasus 38 or something more expensive.

If you look at the medial (inside) view, you’ll notice the rubber goes thin and narrows on the bottom right at the arch which completely removes any arch support. I’m sure this helps keep them as light, which they are extremely, but I would gladly take the small amount of added weight to get some support. If they had more support these would be 5 star all day."

The tongue for the shoe doesn't have any cushion, but doesn't effect the overall comfort too much.  It works best to wear thicker, taller socks with these shoes though.

They are extremely narrow, and without a wide option, I found my feet to be wider, by a large margin, than the actual sole. My feet hang over on the ball of my foot at least a half inch over the actual sole. This isn’t at all comfortable or supportive. It tends to make my ankle want to roll. Second, the elastic band the holds the shoe on at the heel wears out fast, causing the shoe to slip off the heel with every step. It only held its own, maybe a month. I am a psych nurse and was running down the hall to assist a staff member in an emergency situation and one of the shoes flew off my foot. Just in general walking, willfully having to adjust your gait so the shoe won’t slip off is a pretty big issue."

The sole is very flexible and it feels almost like you're walking with heavily padded socks on. I think that's what hurts this shoe the most. By the afternoon my feet hurt and I feel like I've been walking on the hard hospital floors barefoot. They also have no arch support at all. I don't have high arches by any means, and that's not normally a problem I notice. They do stay on very well with the elastic strap, unlike traditional clogs, and the splash resistance has saved my feet a couple times already. I would only recommend these to someone who generally stays in one area at work and does not have to walk around the hospital most of the day. I regret the purchase as I don't think I'll be able to tolerate them to get enough life out of them."

The only thing I have to say is I don’t like the way they look. I wish there were more color options. I got black because that would match most my scrubs. I would have loved an option to buy the emoji original one but I can’t find those anywhere. I’ve had these for a few months now and they look brand new! They’re easy to slip on my feet if I’m in a hurry. They are amazing in showers! No water has seeped in like it has in other shoes! I am telling you! I am in love with these shoes! I wish I could have a multicolored bright colors one I could wear with any color scrubs I wore. Maybe they’ll come back out with new versions?! Please?!! Lol I love Nike!!! It’s all I wear!!"

Just super poor quality, not meant for any form of physical activity (even fast walking). And to boot, no one at Nike has responded to my claim for any sort of refund.

Word of advice if u get them pull the insole out (csrefully as it is glued in slightly) & break it in manually with your hands & then slide it back in the sneaker. Then boom instantly broken in ready to wear & they feel amazing. Not a better basketball sneaker on the market"

I have the lebron 18s and the KDs feel better then those. The zoom and cushlon duo is perfect, feels like your stepping on a cloud but then as your foot releases from each step you feel the zoom immediately propel you. The best way I can describe it is stepping on a memory foam pillow then being propelled by a trampoline on each toe-off. Like I couldn’t care less about the materials, the underfoot is what steals the bacon for this shoe. Traction is great, and upper materials are soft but also do a great job at containing the foot. The strap doesn’t feel like a useless gimmick and doesn’t irritate your foot, even strapped tightly. The top lace did bring some unwanted pressure but just kissing it a little made that issue disappear. So don’t choke the shoe to much in your foot. Other then that this might be the best shoe of 2021 so far."

I also like the stretchable foot opening and how there is not a true \"tongue\" on the shoe as I don't have to worry about the tongue sliding or moving and causing discomfort. This however does make them a little snug to get on/off. I got my normal size and this has been the case but I expect them to stretch a little with wear. I'd imagine for people with wider feet, this could be an issue and they may need to size-up. I also like the extra cushioning around the heel portion for added comfort (pictured) as well as the breathable material throughout the shoe. Overall this is an awesome shoe and I would highly recommend."

My husband sized up half a size and he would really need to size up an entire size for these to fit comfortably. They’re narrow and stiff so with socks on you may even need more than an entire size up. I love the look and feel of the cleats. They’re extremely durable and look like they will last many seasons of soccer! Once my husband gets these in the right size I do think they’ll be very comfortable and be appropriate for long term wear. They definitely need to be broken in because they’re very stiff shoes. Overall, they’re nice. I’d just recommend trying the shoes on in the store before buying them because of the sizing issues and needing to wear soccer socks with them."

At 1/2 lb per shoe, you maximize your endurance with the weightless feeling of the minimal material construction. By design, the shoes fit snugly against the contours of your feet for control and support, while also allowing for natural swelling during activity with their elastic form. The cleats performed exceptionally through various drills after a fresh rain with no loss of agility, and remained comfortable through hours of training. And the NikeGrip insoles have a textured mold to imprint into the shoe to prevent sliding: innovation I wish existed when I played sports in high school. The only drawback with these cleats was when the textured insole wouldn't fit entirely into the grooves of the shoes, creating pressure on the arches of the feet. However, this problem corrected itself after some mild breaking-in of the shoes. Overall, I was very impressed with the Vapor 14 Elite, and I look forward to coaching my kids' soccer team this season."

The form-fitting sock-like nature of the shoe gives a smooth feel on the foot and better touch on the ball. The cleats seem durable and will likely hold up well on both hard and soft ground. They run a bit narrow, though, but his foot is also wide, so keep that in mind if you have wide feet. Overall, these are great soccer cleats and he recommends."

It was a bit of a tight fit at first, but that was expected with new shoes. It fit perfect but without socks, have to break them in first and try with. I tried Jumping, running, jogging with them as well as kicking around the soccer ball for a few days with my son (see him wearing them in the pic lol). Seems great so far. It came with a sports bag which I appreciated.  All in all, a great pair of athletic footwear and would definitely recommend. Will review again after using them for a bit longer and going to our team games with them."

They are more than snug, they are TIGHT. There is a little - a little - room for the toes to wiggle, but putting them on means finding the thinnest socks you can, loosening the laces all the way down, then wiggle, wiggle, wiggle. The Flyknit upper has a little flex, which helps, but it was still a production to get them on the first few times. Once they're on, they're worth it, though. There is a lot of ventilation across the center and above the toebox, and they feel very cool for such a close-fitting shoe. Comfortable to run in, with great traction for agile movement, and they look as fast as they go, too, they're a great choice for a speed-seeking player ... especially if they have narrow feet!"

It is one of the more minimalist shoes I have worn during games and it is built to fit like a glove. I normally wear a men’s size 11 shoe and that is the size I ordered. For the Nike Vapor 14 Elite, I think a size 10 would have placed the studs in a more optimal position and been a better fit. Still, the thin plastic mesh material and lack of tongue is designed to give a sock feel which was surprisingly comfortable. The shoe felt one with my foot the moment I put it on. The studs, despite being the wrong shoe size, are in the exact right place to elevate speed and ball control. I could immediately notice the difference. Sprinting was easy in these shoes. With the minimalist style, striking the ball felt very similar to being barefoot; however, this also meant it took a little more control for juggling and strikes. The single lightweight spine underneath took some time to get used to and I noticed some instability with side to side movement. The only other downside is the material looks impressive but may not be the most durable. I noticed wear on the studs after just a twenty minute pick-up game; I can only imagine how they will look at the end of the full season. If you want a shoe to do long balls or crosses, this probably is not the best for you. However, if you want good ball control and precise strikes, then this shoe would be perfect."

The stretch material on the top of the cleats don't provide enough stretch for people with wide feet. It was very difficult for me to even get them on my feet. By the time my soccer practice was over the top of my foot was rather sore. I wouldn't be able to wear these all day. People with smaller feet would benefit more from these cleats."

As far as fit goes, like most if not all Nike cleats, they’re for narrower feet, wide feet will feel the need to size up even just to get these on and then they won’t be comfortable. The boot style makes these feel so incredibly comfortable and they practically weigh nothing, running and kicking feels good. These stand up to daily kicking around really well, and in actual play I felt pretty nimble in them. Honestly my favorite thing about these boots is how light they are, they really feel so comfortable. I think the only thing that I would call a downside is that they are narrow and the boot style doesn’t make getting them on any easier at first. For me, these were almost the perfect boots."

The designs are different and interesting. Which is why every time I wear them I get a ton of compliments. They are made from materials that provide you with great strides while using. Also they have a padded insole which feels like stepping on clouds. Once breaking them in a bit after a few uses I felt like they became flexible to my foot. You do need to wear them a little bit."

The Nike brand is clearly displayed and is very visible. I really like how my feet don't get super hot and tired in these shoes especially on turf as it does have some breathable holes built into the design fabric. Very good considering the Texas heat. I can easily wear these shoes through a full 90 minute match with no issues. The cleats themselves are great for control both on grass and turf and have caused me no issues. The only recommendation I would suggest is somehow come up with a way to easily adjust the laces without having to manually do each knot from bottom to top to loosen them up especially since the tongue is now built in. Overall great quality shoes and absolutely love the ball control they provide and the breathability during a fast paced game."

My toes don't hurt from playing numerous hours a day on the field. The bottom of my feet also don't feel like they're moving on sandpaper because the material is too thin. These will last a very long time, made of thick reusable material from the outside to the inside. I love the neon-colored stripes on the side of the cleats making sure no one will crash into me when it's game mode. Plus, bright colors on black would make it stand out even more to other soccer players. My favorite thing about the cleats is the overall quality and the good support I get out of them. One thing I might change though is that, they can make the opening to be 1/2 inch wider so it would have been less difficult to fit into them. Otherwise, everything looks and feels great!"

The design is appealing. My favorite feature would be the tongue of the shoe, it has a lot of stretch and is attached to the shoe on all sides which helps with the comfort around the top of the ankle. They came with a great drawstring bag for carrying the shoes that matches the cleats.

          "body": "I really liked the feel of the cleat. The texture on the outside was pleasing to feel and it also had a positive effect on the movement of the soccer ball when I kicked it. The cleats run a little big, so if you like your cleats tight, I would go a half size down. The design and construction of the cleats are durable and seem to be able to last for a long time before any breaks. The cleat overall is comfortable, but if I could change one thing, I would put more cushion in the heel/Achilles part of the cleat. There isn't a lot of cushion in the back which means there is a greater chance for blisters. My recommendation would be to add more cushion in the back part of the cleat, but overall I really like the cleat."

Like all my recent Nikes there is a little heel slip but using the extra lace eyelets and a runners knot resolved this for me.  The tongue  is padded so laces don't cause discomfort.  On grass and drier mud, grip is really good.   I also ran on sand dunes and the grip doesn't do well (if anything would) - I think the chevron style of the terra-kiger would do better on that? "

After stepping on a few puddles as I ran, the water was able to drain from the shoe as opposed to slosh inside the shoe.

I was pleasantly surprised how thick the soles were which helped absorb the impact of the rough terrain. There were some pretty big rocks out there and I could run over them with ease. No issues with sore feet. The Wildhorse’s are slightly heavier than a normal running shoe, but overall not that much of a difference. I was expecting there to be a significant weight difference, but not much at all. The shoes are true to size and fit great. They have nice tread that allow a good grip on the ground and reduce slipping. If looking for a trail running shoe I would definitely recommend."

I have worn them for up to 5 hours at a time and my feet did not complain. I am sure I could wear them all day without being uncomfortable. My favorite thing about this shoe is the clean black and white design that helps them go with any outfit. The only con I have noticed is there is sometimes a squeak to the shoes if they get a little wet. The noise isn’t too loud though and I just try to keep them dry.

Its sole is so soft and provide cushion to my foot. The quality of sole is also good that it does not feel that it will crack after a short time. It’s grip is very strong. I’ve never had a more sturdy but well supported shoes. The shoes is excellent for all sorts of terrains even in mud! During a downpour while running on mud I experienced no slippage and was able to make tight turns with no problem. This is a complete package of style and comfort. It looks very stylish. It is Black and White simple and sober. Even I tried this on mountain for tracking over the weekend. The grip is really good. I would definitely recommend these awesome shoes for tracking and trails."

Finding the right shoe for the tasks is always a challenge; between weight and durability, finding the middle ground of what works takes time. The Wild Horse fits the bill almost perfectly. Although on the heavier side, the padding in the sole and durable tread on the bottom more than makes up for the difference. The lower cut tops have a nice flexible band that acts as a mini gaiter to keep dirt and small rocks from enter the shoe as well."

Not too tight but the perfect amount for a active person. I actually got a chance to go to a pretty rocky trail with them and while they are extremely durable and comfortable to hike in, the ridges on the side take some getting used to or else it could feel off balance. All around this shoe is perfect for any active person who will be doing any sports or hiking. It will keep your feet comfy and safe all while looking extremely stylish."

My feet felt like a comfortable grip; all wrapped up inside a pillow with soles thicker than regular running shoes. These are suitable and supportive for biking, hiking, jogging, camping or just doing lots of walking in the city. The black-and-white design is a color I would wear everyday since they're easy to match with outfits too. The ridges underneath prevent me from slipping and falling on my face. Plus, the bottom is durable but not made of thin material, so my feet don't feel like I'm walking on sandpaper all day. Since all my expectations are met as of now, I can't seem to think of anything else that might need an improvement whether it's the design or stability."

These shoes are fantastic for running in grassy areas or dirt trails; there’s a noticeable difference between these shoes and shoes that are more generic “running shoes.” First, they provide great tread due to the deeper grips on the bottom of the shoes. They also provide a slight lift in the heel while running—making it easier to run in rougher terrain—but not so much lift where you are worried the shoe will come off or cause injuries due to the lack of ankle support. They’re also very comfortable and breathable; I barely noticed I was even wearing shoes while running. Not to mention, they look great!"

These shoes proved to be comfortable for trail runs in the three to five mile range.  I also anticipate wearing these as my primary backpacking shoes as they are rather lightweight. The construction seems durable, so I imagine these will serve me well for some time. My favorite aspects of these shoes are the comfortable fit and solid traction. I would recommend these to trail runners and backpackers. "

The laces lock your heel in pretty well and I have not had any hot spots, which I always deal with when I start a new shoe! Durability wise, these should last. They have reinforced rubber on the toe and heel so you won't get those stick/rock holes. Also, these have a super smart feature where you have elastic that wraps around your ankle to prevent rocks from entering your shoes. No more need for gaiters! I don't know why more shoes/boots don't have this feature and would have killed for this backpacking with trail shoes out west where everything is dusty."

I've tried this shoe with traditional lacing. I prefer the look of the Flyease and they go on just as easily as claimed, but they're not as secure as traditional lacing. The upper on these makes me more confident investing in white shoes- they're much easier to clean than flyknit, almost wipe clean with water. Also, they run SMALL! If I got the appropriate size for length, I feel like I'd be swimming in the mid and forefoot of the upper due to lacing. I'm returning and hoping the next iteration features a more functional speed lacing system. If I had more dough, I'd keep these for tempo runs and just to wear around bc they look so so good."

However, the lace system isn't ready for prime time, IMO.  It doesn't consistently cinch in the same places or even uniformly across the foot - it tends to be tighter in some areas than others, often leading to a fair degree of restriction.  I love the idea and only wish they actually lived up to the intent of the design."

The tempos are excellent shoes but little tight around the ankles.  The flyease are much more comfortable around the ankle, easy to put on and off.  Now it’s maybe just bad luck but I have bought two pairs and both have had the flyease lacing break. The first pair I decided to keep and just made them into standard laces. The second pair I’ll probably return. Would love to see Nike make this shoe with standard lacing, as for me, would be a perfect running shoe.  Also the do squeak terribly, I mean really loud.  As I only use them for outdoor running no biggie, but if your someone who would wear these daily then it’s gets irritating very fast."

My only reservation about these shoes is that the \"Flyknit\" technology is not as stretchy as I thought it would be. I'm used to the Infinity Run Flyknit shoes that conform around the foot, and the AF1s are not as stretchy as those. That's okay though, because they're actually kind of wide. Needless to say they've become my everyday shoe. I plan on buying more pairs in different colors. I'm tempted to buy OG AF1s, but I'm not sure that they fit the same as these. "

I mainly use them when lifting because they have a flat bottom, so they are perfect for that. Once they’re slightly broken in they’re fine."

Super flexible lining around the ankles, gives full range of motion without feeling restrictive. Nike Free midsole makes them pretty light, while also incorporating the firmness you’d want from a skate shoe. Mesh around the swoosh also makes them super breathable. Overall, definitely worth the money."

After breaking in after a few sessions, they feel good, but I definitely treat these like I would soccer cleats - they come off after skating and aren't super comfortable for off-time wear. But that's alright, skate shoes have come a long way and the tech in these is awesome! If you have a flat or wide foot though, be prepared to return it. But Nike has an excellent return policy so definitely skate it for a week and see how it goes!"

With that being said, I will say they run to size and I would order your usual size if you don’t want any heel slip.

I pulled the trigger thinking, I can always return them if they were indeed too small.  I get the lifters in, and at first, they were tight (most reviews did state they ran small).  I have a wide foot but after a few days lifting in them, they stretched out, which mitigated the heel slip issue many have complained of (tying the shoe laces tight and or strapping in the top strap all but eliminates that too btw)  "

I run between 50-75k a week and have put in about 600k in my first pair of Peg 38 so far and thanks to Nike App 4th anniversary birthday have ordered a pair of the BRS Tiger orange colour way at a great discounted price! Next stop later in the year will be the Vaporfly Next% 2 although the price point for those is much higher. Great work Nike!"

The heel area with the split heel counter feels very comfortable and really locks your foot down A+. The mid and forefoot area have adequate space for my feet (which are not particularly wide or narrow). The only area that could use improvement is the medial side of the toe box. It curves in rather quickly and I do get some rubbing on my big toe. The upper is also a touch thick…at least for the summer months. Overall though, a great shoe!"

They are bolder than I, as a woman with larger feet who always wants to downplay that feature, would typically go for. The black around the edge helped minimize the size issue for me though. If you are looking to make a statement with your sneakers, these fit the bill."

I normally wear a 10 but, these run small so I would definitely size up. Another great feature especially after running 2 or 3 games, is that the thin  mesh on the sides of the shoe make them very breathable.  But by far my favorite part of the shoe (see picture) is the memory form support on the back side of your ankle. This form support cradles your ankles as your breaking ankles on the court. I would definitely recommend these shoes if your in the market for some new basketball shoes."

It does run narrow and would have gotten a half size bigger if I would have known.  But even though my pinky toes were a little uncomfortable the overall comfort of the shoe sort of made up for it. The inside of the shoe is like walking on a soft mattress and the shoe absorbs a lot of the impact. The shoe is a high back shoe and even though I usually don't like them, the shoe was comfortable and it didn't bother me at all. Because the shoe was a little narrow and my pinky toes were feeling the brunt of it, I couldn't wear it for more than a few hours but if the size was correct, this is the type of shoe that I could totally wear all day long. If I could change anything, it would be the narrowness towards the front. This would solve the size issue! Besides that, I LOVE this shoe and it's my new go to from  walking the hills around my house to taking family pictures"

I would have needed to size up at least a half size, maybe even a full size. I can wear them, they’re just a little too tight and my toes are squished in the end. Keep that in mind if you’re ordering. Size up at least a half size! Overall, these are amazing kicks and my wife loves them since they do fit her. She’s about a size 10 in women, and these are 11’s. Something to think about! I highly recommend, though. The colors are vibrant and so much better in person!"

Like a lot of others, im extremely picky with the shoes I skate in but these definitely did their job."

(I heelflip with my toes all the way on the board almost like an ollie) It took me a month to just get a hole in these! I ripped the top and bottom lace in these but that was it even with the lace saver option. Immediately bought another pair and shoe gooed the ones I have on hand cause once broken in these things are magical and I don't want to skate another shoe. Besides maybe some SB dunks but whos getting their hands on them these days anyways. Which by the way Nike can we can we get a non hype SB dunks for us skaters pleeeeasseeeeee?"

Well here it is: The initial fit is slightly less restrictive in width, which I always found a bit tight with Janoskis. The support in general is very similar, making your foot feel snug, but still low profile enough to get amazing board feel. The shape of the toe is a bit rounder, which might not be to everyone's taste in terms of flick for board control, but I've come to love it. The lace hoops keep everything locked in for as long as possible, and overall they skate really nice after a few days breaking in. They're not going to last for ages, and they're not going to be able to skate straight away, but there you go."

The fabric is translucent in some areas, so they pair well with fun socks. I'm a dad, and I feel this shoe fits my lifestyle running after kids without making me feel like I'm in a \"dad shoe.\" The fit is snug and comfortable. I have good support in these and didn't feel like I was dying to take them off at the end of the day. My favorite part of them is their look and comfort. I like how lightweight they are, but I could go for a thicker tongue and the thin fabric on the top crinkles a bit by my toes. I'm mostly worried about their durability as my kids step on my feet or roll their bikes over them or any other wear and tear. They ran big for me, so that could've lap contributed to the crinkling of fabric near my toes."

I made an initial judgment of the shoe based off the aesthetics alone. However, once I actually tried the shoes on, my feet were in heaven. I have somewhat of a high arch, and the slide accommodates that. My foot is also very narrow so I thought the shoes might feel larger because of that combined with the bulkiness. I was wrong. The shoe fit like a glove with just enough length and width. I have not had the opportunity to wear the shoe all day, but wearing it for the several hours that I have so far has convinced me that the shoe would be comfortable to wear all day. Slides like these are my go-to for something quick to put on my feet to walk around the house or run some errands. It is beginning to warm up where I am so I have not worn them with socks, but I would imagine that the slides would work really well with socks too. My favorite part of the  slide is the design on the portion of the shoe that covers your foot. The neutral colors allow it to pair with most things that I wear. The versatility and comfortability of the slides make them a great choice for this type of shoe, and this is saying a lot from someone who loves these types of slides."

His feedback has been positive about these shoes; I actually caught him trying to leave the house in these, in the middle of winter, with socks on, so I would say he loves them! He would wear them all day if I let him, but that will have to wait for warmer weather when he is willing to wear them sockless. He is very impressed that these have nice arch support, and he loves the soft padded top strap that is aerated underneath so that his feet can breathe. He says that they fit well and are quite comfortable. Being used to traditional flip-flops, he was concerned that they would slide off when walking, but he finds that they stay on no problem. The only complaint that he has had is that there is a groove on the bottom of the sandal that makes the heel squish down pretty far, and he feels it would be better if it had a solid bottom, perhaps with some extra cushioning at the heel. That being said, he is a pretty big guy so it probably wouldn’t be an issue for most people, and it is a minor complaint for him anyways.  These have become his go-to shoe and he would recommend them for anyone looking for a great all-around sandal."

There is slight arch support and only a slightly molded footbed. They do tend to make my feet a little hot, but my feet always run a bit warm. The slides are great for putting on after a long day of work. I’m not a huge fan of the urban camo look so I don’t plan on wearing these in public. They’re a nice around the house, comfort slide."

While wearing the slides, they continued to contoured and almost molded to his feet making them even more comfortable with each wear. He also loved how the arch support of the slide was supportive and comfortable. One thing that he mentioned right away was how the tops of the slides really held onto his food without hurting his foot. He has had some other slides that the top part was either too lose so the slide moved around or it’s too tight hurting the tops of his feet. These were made for Goldilocks, they were just right. He said that the tops were absolutely perfect. He did walk around the block a handful of times with our kids and said they were very durable. He didn’t feel like the slide was going to crack or come apart. He didn’t even slide around while walking outside on some of the ice that accumulated on the sidewalk. He had absolutely nothing negative to say about these slides. He’s in love. I will absolutely buy a pair of these slides for him and I would highly recommend anyone looking for a new summer slide."

I was shocked at the shock absorption of these shoes. Comparing these to my other sandals, these were the priciest (by a few dollars) but most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever worn, even compared to other name brands. My wife stole these from me and even agreed after giving the \"huh!\" expression. I also gave that expression too as I was not expecting this level of sophistication. It's lightweight yet feels strong, has a soft foam that grips well. I have worn these all day. I tried them with and without socks to test the grip and comfort and it handles well in various occasions - including running sideways with my 2 year old toddler. These have now become my primary go-to sandal!"

The cushioning is nice,  but not personally a fan of the arch support.  They float, which is great for the pool/lake/river, Seem very durable so far. "

I have wide feet and it usually takes me time to \"break in\" new sneakers, but these felt supportive and molded nicely to my feet from the very first wear. The padding that surrounds the heel was much thicker than most of my other sneakers which took a bit getting used to (and I wasn't sure if I liked it at first), but after a while, I found that I did indeed enjoy and appreciate the extra padding and support. I took the sneakers on a few runs and found them to be supportive, lightweight, and breathable in the Arizona heat (a necessity!). The styling of the shoe itself is sharp, clean, and I really like the contrast of the black detailing against the grey sneaker. Overall, I am very happy with these sneakers and consistently find myself reaching for them over my other pairs."

Not the best running shoes, but it is okay for weight lifting. What I like most about the shoes is that it's lightweight and breathable.

However, the Nike MC Trainer offers a great deal of support. They had really great foot cushioning that was firm but not hard. The ankles were cushy but also well supported especially since there was an added durable layer surrounding the back of the ankle. The material was very breathable and although the shoes aren't the lightest, they still felt quite light."

They do take a little bit to break them in, but once that’s done, they’re & pretty comfortable to wear all day long. The fact they they are light weight & ventilated makes them perfect for the Florida heat. The design of the shoe is just enough to give it a touch of style without being over the top, which my husband is not a fan of. They’re great for switching activities from riding bikes & playing football one minute, to running to the grocery store the next. Overall, they’re a good supportive & stylish shoe at a reasonable price point. Would recommend them out based on our positive experience with them."

The initial fit for me was good though my feet are on the wide side so these were a little extra snug until they broke in a bit. They also fit lower on my ankle than some of my other shoes. Which on first impression seemed odd but I found it to be more comfortable when wearing these for my daily workouts. The sole is very comfortable with a good grounded feel without too much extra cushion. The uppers provide great ventilation which is also a very nice feature in a trainer. As for the looks, I felt the design was straightforward and sleek without being overstated. I could and would wear this shoe all day though I usually have to change out my footwear as work and weather dictate. If there is one thing I would change it might be widening the footbed out and bringing it up a little higher especially in the heel but that is merely my preference. Overall I find the Nike MC Trainer to be a solid shoe that gives me what I need in the gym and keeps my feet cool and dry."

He said they immediately fit perfectly and are very comfortable and supportive. However, he reports that the soles aren't as grippy as he'd like on some of the slippery, hilly sidewalks we have here in Seattle. So these shoes are probably best for the gym or other indoor usage, or for dry ground."

These shoes are comfortable enough to wear all day and that fact, combined with the sleek design, means I can wear them to work, to play with my kids, and to workout.  They are very lightweight and breathable, which are my two biggest pros.  They also come in several colors so I would be happy to have more than one pair.  I do have a few minor cons/things I would change.  Firstly, while I am able to wear them all day, I would have liked the option to choose a wide size as they get more narrow towards the toe.  This may resolve itself as I break the shoe in more, but typically I would choose wide.  Secondly, the material of the side of the shoe, not the fabric, but the white portion is easily creased/damaged and after one day of wearing them was noticeable.  I suspect that they may not hold up well over time and will be increasingly difficult to keep clean.  Lastly, the laces tie a bit higher and put pressure on the ankle where I am not used to; this is not a deal breaker, but it would be great if there was another lace hole between the top two.   Overall, I am generally happy with them and will continue wearing them for as long as they last."

The more you walk on it you get used to it.  The shoe is well-made and sturdy. Your feet feel secure in it! One of my favorite features is the look of the shoe and design.

You can walk on all kinds of terrain and the soles of the shoes protect your feet. There’s nothing worse than having soft soles and being able to feel rocks while walking. I really liked the narrow look of the shoe, but when the shoes were on, they certainly didn’t feel narrow or uncomfortable. The only thing I would change would be the laces. The placement of the top shoe string holes are a little too high up for me but there’s not another option to move it down. It can be done but it’s too loose. Overall, I would definitely recommend giving these shoes a try. For the price, they are 100% worth it."

We went with the grey and I feel like there’s definitely something about the grey specifically that comes off as a dad shoe. He is, in fact, a dad though- so it works for us. The shoe is definitely comfortable and he likes how multipurpose they feel- being able to use them on the treadmill but also wearing them to the store. I would’ve given them 5 stars if the fit was a bit better and the design a little younger."

Overall I can wear them day in and day out and not feel the normal achy feeling in my feet I normally would get after a long day of work, so I'm happy.

Nike took great care in their box presentation and the quality of shoe felt awesome pulling it out. Unfortunately for me, that's where my taste for the shoe stopped. The shoes look nice and the Air Max red highlight against the grey is a nice touch but they weren't quite my style. Putting them on reminded me of the those shoes you see a good cook BBQ dad or uncle wear, but I thought maybe it was just a matter of my initial taste so I laced the bad boys up and wore them out on a quick out of town trip. Usually I get compliments on my shoes and this was not one of those times. I take pride that my shoes usually make a statement and attract other sneaker heads or at least get the random \"sweet shoes\" comment. These did not as they kind of just blended in as a normal casual shoe. So the appearance design was a bust for me, but I really have to brag about the comfort of the shoe. If it weren't for the way these specific shoes looked (nice looking shoe but again not my taste), I would wear these shoes ALL DAY! These were some of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. We ran, walked for miles, got on a couple of trails and these shoes held up and were soooo comfortable. That for me was honestly these shoes' saving grace! The fit was specific to size and the materials weren't heavy and breathe really well. I'll be excited to see if Nike comes out with other color options and would definitely give those a try!"

If you’re a parent, you already know how tiring and exhausting it is to chase after a toddler but this shoe kept me going the full day and my feet weren’t sore at the end of the night! It provided me with enough support, but also super comfortable, for me to run around in. Not heavy and definitely wasn’t anything that made my feet super hot or sweaty either. It’s nicely designed so it’s not like I’m wearing a mom/dad shoe, but provides the support I need. Definitely would suggest to factor in if you have wide feet or if you wear thick socks. When you factor those in, these run true to size. The absolute best part is that they don’t look huge on my feet either! They go well with everything. Love them!"

I think it’s the the air max portion of the shoe that has you feel like you’re walking on a cloud all day mixed with the nice thick and cushy insoles. I’m about 6 ft tall and around 225lb and work out a lot, so I can honestly say you shouldn’t have a problem with comfort or durability for anyone around a similar size or smaller . (don’t see why it wouldn’t also be the same for bigger guys as well.) I love the design of these and the color I have is white so they go with anything I decide to wear, whether it’s with shorts to the gym or jeans to meet up with friends at dinner. I personally love the crisp clean white color, but I know how hard white shoes can be to keep clean at times, I sprayed them with a protector and that’s helped a lot. Also there’s a lot of other color combos they have in this shoe if white is not your color. So overall I would definitely recommend the Nike Men’s Air Max Excee for all around look , comfort, and durability, especially if you’re on your feet a lot like I am and an active person these will be a great fit for you."

These are my first pair of Nike Air Max's and I love the style of them as they will go perfect with shorts or a pair of jeans. These shoes were comfortable enough to wear all day long; I would definitely recommend these to anyone that is looking for a stylish casual pair of shoes.

The comfort of these shoes delivered, as expected. These guys know how to make a shoe you can wear all day long. Whether going for a run or running to the store. The only complaint I have on sizing is the toe box was a little narrow from what I have experienced in the past with Nike's. I like a little more room at the ball of my foot than was offered. They may stretch out to accommodate my foot over time (though I am a standard width) but time will tell. All around these are a really solid shoe and will be wearing them everywhere."

My husband has an average width foot in every shoe he has ever worn and said that it felt like his pinky toe was hanging off of the toe box. They also fit very snug through the mid foot area so I would size up if you don’t like tight fitting shoes. The overall appearance of the shoes is sleek and athletic looking and they are less bulky than a traditional basketball shoe. They provide good ankle support while being fairly low profile. My husband said he would’ve preferred a little more mobility and flexibility through the rest of the shoe though. When he first started wearing them, they were pretty hard and didn’t feel like they had much cushioning, but as they got broken in they became much more comfortable, and my husband said he could see wearing them all day once they relaxed some. The best part of these shoes is the good, solid ankle support in them. I would change the width to make them a little bit wider in the toe box. I recommend trying them on to see if you like the snug performance fit."

The shoe does what a lot of Nike shoes do, at least in my experience, which is runs a little small...I could've use a half-size bigger for it to be more comfortable. It was too tight to comfortable wear no-show socks, so I went without...which actually turns out is ok because the inside is moisture wicking and felt like a sock, surprisingly comfortable! I also felt like I had great support in this shoe, even as a low-top, which is impressive. While I didn't wear this all day long because it was just a little too small, it was comfortable enough to run, and to run errands with my kids, too. "

I’m usually a size 9 U.K. but because of the heel support in this shoe I tried a 9.5 and a 10. I’ve gone for the 10 but it was close. If I preferred closer fit and was using it for sports I might have chosen the 9.5. It’s a very comfy shoe, I love the design and the heel support is top notch!"

The Nike Lebron XVIII Lo will easily carry you through long days on and off the court as it is amazingly supportive. Although not quite my style, the color is eye-catching and vibrant. I also like that this lo has more of the styling of a mid top basketball shoe. My favorite aspect of the Nike Lebron XVIII Lo would have to be the superior ankle support. The only thing I might change would be the color options, but overall an excellent basketball shoe."

I normally wear a 10 but, these run small so I would definitely size up. Another great feature especially after running 2 or 3 games, is that the thin  mesh on the sides of the shoe make them very breathable.  But by far my favorite part of the shoe (see picture) is the memory form support on the back side of your ankle. This form support cradles your ankles as your breaking ankles on the court.

It does run narrow and would have gotten a half size bigger if I would have known.  But even though my pinky toes were a little uncomfortable the overall comfort of the shoe sort of made up for it. The inside of the shoe is like walking on a soft mattress and the shoe absorbs a lot of the impact. The shoe is a high back shoe and even though I usually don't like them, the shoe was comfortable and it didn't bother me at all. Because the shoe was a little narrow and my pinky toes were feeling the brunt of it, I couldn't wear it for more than a few hours but if the size was correct, this is the type of shoe that I could totally wear all day long. If I could change anything, it would be the narrowness towards the front. This would solve the size issue!

I would have needed to size up at least a half size, maybe even a full size. I can wear them, they’re just a little too tight and my toes are squished in the end. Keep that in mind if you’re ordering. Size up at least a half size! Overall, these are amazing kicks and my wife loves them since they do fit her. She’s about a size 10 in women, and these are 11’s.
