    "\n",
    "This proejct is about building an algorithm that'd be able to take all the reviews for a certain product and generate one single review that summarizes all the reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that instead of having a customer reading 200 reviews, he’ll only have to read one review. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case i crawled the Nike.com website using a scrapping tool called Scrappy while using a container and gathered all the data about the Men's shoes, then the algorithm was able to create a summarized review for every single shoe. The algorithm was also able to clean the data from any duplicate reviews and clean the data so it doesn’t show products that don't have any reviews. Although the more data and reviews there's for a shoe, the easier it is for the algorithm to create a summzarized review."

I bought it just a couple days ago for a race, and ran a 6KM in 25:51. The shoes had great traction and the comfort is through the roof. I love the colour scheme, and it doesn't get super dirty easily. The fit is snug but leaves room, and though it is a bit narrow for my foot it stretches out as well. Will edit this after I finish the season, but so far so good overa \n",

Extremely comfortable straight out of the box. Super grip and good cushioning. The neoprene? collar at the back is a very interesting addition and makes the shoe very easy to put on and take off and should also help to stop blisters. Highly recommended\n",

The shoes have a lot of padding on the bottom and you do not feel the small rocks you step on. Very springy and comfortable. Seems very well constructed. Probably the best investment for light to moderate summer (not waterproof) hiking or running. If you are using these for hiking just be a ware that there is absolutely no support \n",

The tread on the side helps a lot both in the rugged terrain and when climbing a slipper mud soaked rope. Other racers were struggling to grip the rope with their feet but the side tread on these helped me get a really solid bite. I loved the way the top of the shoe forms close to a seal on my foot, kept a lot of water and mud out.\n",

I have been working out in the as I prepare for my Spartan race and everything I want from a shoe it has. You want to put on a shoe and forget you have them on! Yup, check the box. These are them. Breathable on the feet and although a little larger than the others I looked at, they are very light. I also feel supported on the shoe. So far so good. After my race I will update.\n",

I am very happy with them and will definitely look to purchase more of these in the future!!\n",

For most shoes I go up half a size but went true to size in these so my feet wont slip inside the show on technical terrain, despite that my feet don't feel squashed even on longer 10KM runs.   Like all my recent Nikes there is a little heel slip but using the extra lace eyelets and a runners knot resolved this for me.  The tongue  is padded so laces don't cause discomfort.  On grass and drier mud, grip is really good.   I also ran on sand dunes and the grip doesn't do well (if anything would) - I think the chevron style of the terra-kiger would do better on that? \n",

Works perfect for both -- super grippy on the track and comfortable and the same goes for the mountain trails. The only complaint I have is the wide heel lends to some instability in the ankle area however I opted for these because of the additional shock absorption at the heel so this is an acceptable compromise for me personally. Even how they are, I ran a trail and had no issues with rolling my ankles. Overall, incredible shoe for the trails as well as running.\n",

I am an avid runner and hiker and often run on the Appalachian Trail in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The Nike Wildhorse 7 shoes did not require any break in period whatsoever. Trails tend to get super muddy and filled with puddles. This shoe has excellent drainage. After stepping on a few puddles as I ran, the water was able to drain from the shoe as opposed to slosh inside the shoe. Overall, this has been my favorite trail shoe thus far and I cannot wait to take it on obstacle course races in the summer!\n",

It’s hard to find shoes that are both fashionable and comfortable, but these are both. They fit perfect very true to size. I also love the look of this shoe. It’s very versatile and can go with many different outfits.I went on a pretty difficult hike in this shoe and overall my feet feel great afterwards. They seem to hold up well and very durable. I had them on for 9+ hours and no complaints at all. Overall these are great shoes for all day wear and enjoying outdoor activities. Highly recommended.\n",

I was excited to try these out on the rocky running trails, and for hiking up the steep hills. The Wildhorse’s did not disappoint! Very durable shoe and very supportive. Running over rocks was no problem! I was pleasantly surprised how thick the soles were which helped absorb the impact of the rough terrain. There were some pretty big rocks out there and I could run over them with ease. No issues with sore feet. The Wildhorse’s are slightly heavier than a normal running shoe, but overall not that much of a difference. I was expecting there to be a significant weight difference, but not much at all. The shoes are true to size and fit great. They have nice tread that allow a good grip on the ground and reduce slipping. If looking for a trail running shoe I would definitely recommend.\n",

Being Nike, I held them to a high standard. They fit perfectly, which is always something I worry about when getting shoes online. Definitely a true to size fit. The look goes well with either athletic wear or jeans. I have used these both for exercising at the gym and running out to the grocery store. I have worn them for up to 5 hours at a time and my feet did not complain. I am sure I could wear them all day without being uncomfortable. My favorite thing about this shoe is the clean black and white design that helps them go with any outfit. The only con I have noticed is there is sometimes a squeak to the shoes if they get a little wet. The noise isn’t too loud though and I just try to keep them dry. Looking forward to wearing these shoes more during the warmer weather.\n",

I love black and white shoes, and these certainly fit the bill. They are easy to wipe down and keep clean and free of dust. The bottoms are great with traction and a good build for basketball and working out. I found them to fit slightly larger than my average shoes in the same size. They are quite comfortable and do give you a nice feel on your feet; where you fee like your getting somewhere with your workout. I would definitely buy these again.\n",

The fit was perfect for me once i broke them in. I really liked how much support they offered for whatever i did in them. I have a young son, so i do a lot of running and chasing after him. The bottom of the shoe almost reminded me of cleats(though not quite that extreme) Which made it really comfortable running in the grass/dirt around my home. Even used them on the bike and they were pretty great on there as well. So far so good.\n",

The quality of sole is also good that it does not feel that it will crack after a short time. It’s grip is very strong. I’ve never had a more sturdy but well supported shoes. The shoes is excellent for all sorts of terrains even in mud! During a downpour while running on mud I experienced no slippage and was able to make tight turns with no problem. This is a complete package of style and comfort. It looks very stylish. It is Black and White simple and sober. Even I tried this on mountain for tracking over the weekend. The grip is really good.

Finding the right shoe for the tasks is always a challenge; between weight and durability, finding the middle ground of what works takes time. The Wild Horse fits the bill almost perfectly. Although on the heavier side, the padding in the sole and durable tread on the bottom more than makes up for the difference. The lower cut tops have a nice flexible band that acts as a mini gaiter to keep dirt and small rocks from enter the shoe as well.\n",

Upon removing the show from the box I thought how well designed the Wlidhorse 7’s are. Very stylish for a trail shoe, the ridges on the bottom gave it a very sporty/ cleats look. When I tried them on my foot immediately felt comfy inside. Not too tight but the perfect amount for a active person. I actually got a chance to go to a pretty rocky trail with them and while they are extremely durable and comfortable to hike in, the ridges on the side take some getting used to or else it could feel off balance. All around this shoe is perfect for any active person who will be doing any sports or hiking. It will keep your feet comfy and safe all while looking extremely stylish.\n",
      "1664    I didn't expect these Nike Wildhorse 7 to be as comfortable as I thought at first because they looked chunky in appearance when taking them out of the box. I seemed to have picked a pair by half a size bigger (size 8.5) than my feet, but should fit not too badly with thick-layered socks. However, I was very wrong. My feet felt like a comfortable grip; all wrapped up inside a pillow with soles thicker than regular running shoes. These are suitable and supportive for biking, hiking, jogging, camping or just doing lots of walking in the city. The black-and-white design is a color I would wear everyday since they're easy to match with outfits too. The ridges underneath prevent me from slipping and falling on my face. Plus, the bottom is durable but not made of thin material, so my feet don't feel like I'm walking on sandpaper all day. Since all my expectations are met as of now, I can't seem to think of anything else that might need an improvement whether it's the design or stability.\n",

These shoes are fantastic for running in grassy areas or dirt trails; there’s a noticeable difference between these shoes and shoes that are more generic “running shoes.” First, they provide great tread due to the deeper grips on the bottom of the shoes. They also provide a slight lift in the heel while running—making it easier to run in rougher terrain—but not so much lift where you are worried the shoe will come off or cause injuries due to the lack of ankle support. They’re also very comfortable and breathable; I barely noticed I was even wearing shoes while running. Not to mention, they look great!\n",

They are so comfortable and don't leave my feet aching after a long run or hiking. I would recommend these any day, I was a little shocked at the price but after wearing these they are worth every penny in comfort. I have back issues and have had back surgery so finding comfortable shoes to walk, hike and run in are a must and with these shoes I would say I've found the jackpot!\n",

They provide a soft and squishy feel while remaining rigid enough for serious trail running. I particularly like the nubby soles as they provide great traction on loose gravel and dirt. The fit is true to size. The design of the shoe is attractive and \"looks\" the part for a trail runner sneaker. However, I do wish that these came in more fun colors. These shoes proved to be comfortable for trail runs in the three to five mile range.  I also anticipate wearing these as my primary backpacking shoes as they are rather lightweight. The construction seems durable, so I imagine these will serve me well for some time. My favorite aspects of these shoes are the comfortable fit and solid traction. I would recommend these to trail runners and backpackers. \n",

I live in a very active community and I take advantage of all the stuff - hiking, biking, running, etc.  These are my new go-tos.  Great for running on bumpy sidewalks as well as dusty/muddy trails.  Great for casual biking.  And they look good enough to wear with jeans for my weekend errands.  These really had no break-in period - they were ready to go right out of the box.  My normal runs are around 5 miles and so far, these have excelled.  Definitely recommend!\n",

The comfort and support of this Nike shoe feels like you are running in slippers. You get the bounce and support of their running and sprinting shoes which make roots feel like nothing. The tread is cleat-like so you don't have slippage. The laces lock your heel in pretty well and I have not had any hot spots, which I always deal with when I start a new shoe! Durability wise, these should last. They have reinforced rubber on the toe and heel so you won't get those stick/rock holes. Also, these have a super smart feature where you have elastic that wraps around your ankle to prevent rocks from entering your shoes. No more need for gaiters! I don't know why more shoes/boots don't have this feature and would have killed for this backpacking with trail shoes out west where everything is dusty.\n",

Love the pull loops on the back for putting on quickly. Breathable mesh uppers help air circulation and prevent hot/sweaty feet. I could easily wear these all day if needed. Styling is great as well. Love the mountain graphic design on the back. It’s a great touch for these shoes which are meant to be worn off the beaten path. I can’t think of any improvements needed.
